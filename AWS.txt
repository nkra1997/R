### **Steps to Set Up an EC2 Instance**

1. **Login to AWS Management Console**  
   - Go to [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) and log in using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to EC2 Dashboard**  
   - From the AWS Management Console, search for and select **EC2** under the "Services" menu.

3. **Launch Instance**  
   - Click on **Launch Instances** to start creating a new EC2 instance.

4. **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**  
   - Select an AMI that represents the operating system and configuration you want for your instance (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows).

5. **Select an Instance Type**  
   - Choose an instance type based on the required CPU, memory, and network capacity.  
   - For basic purposes, select **t2.micro** (free tier eligible).

6. **Configure Instance Details**  
   - Set up details like the number of instances, network (VPC), subnet, and enable auto-assignment of public IP if needed.  
   - Leave default settings for basic setups.

7. **Add Storage**  
   - Specify the size and type of storage (EBS) to attach to your instance.  
   - Default is usually 8GB.

8. **Add Tags (Optional)**  
   - Add tags to organize and identify your instance, e.g., **Key: Name, Value: MyEC2Instance**.

9. **Configure Security Group**  
   - Set up inbound and outbound rules for network traffic.  
   - For basic access, allow SSH (port 22) for Linux or RDP (port 3389) for Windows.  
   - Specify allowed IP ranges (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 for all).

10. **Review and Launch**  
    - Review all settings, verify instance configuration, and click **Launch**.

11. **Select or Create Key Pair**  
    - Create a new key pair (if not already created) or use an existing one.  
    - Download the private key file (*.pem) and store it securely. You will need it to access the instance.

12. **Launch the Instance**  
    - Click **Launch Instances** and wait for the instance to initialize.

13. **Access the Instance**  
    - Use an SSH client (for Linux) or Remote Desktop (for Windows) to connect to your EC2 instance using the key pair downloaded earlier.

Your EC2 instance is now up and running! You can use it for hosting applications, running services, or testing environments.
