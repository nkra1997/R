### **Steps to Create a Virtual Machine (VM) Using Oracle VirtualBox**

1. **Download and Install VirtualBox**  
   - Download Oracle VirtualBox from the official website and install it on your computer.

2. **Launch VirtualBox**  
   - Open the VirtualBox application.

3. **Click on "New"**  
   - Click the **New** button to start creating a new virtual machine.

4. **Enter VM Name and OS Type**  
   - Provide a name for the VM (e.g., "Ubuntu VM").  
   - Select the operating system type (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.) and version.

5. **Allocate Memory (RAM)**  
   - Choose the amount of RAM to allocate to the VM.  
   - Ensure you leave enough RAM for the host OS.

6. **Create a Virtual Hard Disk**  
   - Select **Create a virtual hard disk now**.  
   - Choose a hard disk file type (default is VDI - VirtualBox Disk Image).  
   - Decide between **Dynamically Allocated** (expands as needed) or **Fixed Size** (predefined size).  
   - Set the disk size and location, then click **Create**.

7. **Configure Settings (Optional)**  
   - After creating the VM, click on **Settings** to adjust configurations like network, USB, or shared folders.

8. **Insert Installation Media**  
   - Attach an ISO file of the desired operating system by selecting **Storage** in settings.  
   - Click on the empty optical drive and choose the ISO file.

9. **Start the Virtual Machine**  
   - Click the **Start** button to power on the VM.  
   - Follow the installation steps for the chosen OS inside the VM.

10. **Install Guest Additions (Optional)**  
    - After installing the OS, insert the "Guest Additions" ISO from VirtualBox's menu for better performance, shared clipboard, and enhanced display options.
